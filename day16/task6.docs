---> JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language. 


---> It is multi-paradigm: supporting imperative, object-oriented and functional programming styles. 

---> JavaScript uses dynamic typing, meaning variables don’t require explicit types and can change types at runtime. 


---> It is platform independent—JavaScript code can run in many environments (browsers, servers, desktops) without needing recompilation. 


---> It supports first-class functions: functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, returned from other functions. 


---> JavaScript features closure: functions remember the environment in which they were created (lexical scope) even when executed later. 


---> The language uses prototype-based inheritance rather than classical class‐based inheritance (though ES6 introduced class syntax). 


---> Since ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) JavaScript has formal class syntax, modules (import/export), arrow functions, let and const, template literals, destructuring, etc. 


---> JavaScript supports asynchronous programming via callbacks, promises, and async/await. 


---> It is case-sensitive (variable names, function names distinguish upper/lower case). 


---> JavaScript is event-driven — especially in the browser environment, it can react to user actions like clicks, keypresses, form submissions. 


---> It offers built-in support for JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which is widely used for data interchange between client and server.

---> JavaScript supports modules, enabling code organization and reusability by splitting into files and using import/export. 

---> With the arrival of Node.js, JavaScript moved from browser-only to server-side and full-stack development. 


---> JavaScript has built-in standard objects (Array, Object, Map, Set, WeakMap, etc) and supports new data structures like BigInt, Symbol.

---> The ECMAScript standard is updated annually, with new features like optional chaining, nullish coalescing, private class fields, iterator helpers.

---> JavaScript is highly portable and supported across all modern web browsers via built-in JavaScript engines (e.g., V8 engine in Chrome). 

---> It allows dynamic object construction and introspection (objects can be built/modified at runtime, properties may be added or deleted).

---> JavaScript supports asynchronous, non-blocking I/O (especially in server environments) enabling scalable real-time applications. 


--->JavaScript’s ecosystem is vast: countless frameworks, libraries, tools, transpilers (e.g., Babel) support modern development; it remains central to web, mobile & desktop app development.
